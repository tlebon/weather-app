# Welcome to Weather To Go

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/bf7429c7-588e-44a3-8145-49e5ce9af33b/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/musing-einstein-5bf189/deploys)

This is a simple weather app made in react with Typescript using the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api#how).

## Design Decisions

The app was quickly boostrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), with typescript added. 

The App was originally storyboarded in Figma, you can see the designs attached and the link to the project.

As the open weather map api charges 40$ for a month to get the nice endpoints with longer time scales, I simply added two calls together.

## ADD DESIGNS AND LINK HERE

The project is deployed on netlify, you can see a live instance running here.

## ADD LINK

Your free openweathermap APIKEY should go in your .env file, please refer to the .env example file.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` - this will start the project

### `npm test` - this will run some tests

### `npm run build` - this will build for production, i dont think youll need that. 

## Getting Started with Create React App
